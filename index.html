Getting his energy from the sun through “solar arcs” he is able to have great power depending on his exposure. His abilities include Flight, 1-100x Strength-Speed, 1-100x Senses and Ray Vision. It is unbeknownst to Angel that his use of the solar arcs causes the sun to become unstable. He ultimately “sacrifices” himself to keep the sun at ease.

He creates an image of terror called the Night to combat corruption in the great metropolis using his fortune and intelligence. The endless combatants he’s fought against haunt him but enhance his abilities. There are times when he talks to them when he is alone. Each enemy he defeats help him construct his paradise.</p>
                        <p>Night’s “ghost”: "Alfred" Scarecrow, Black Joker (ruler of underworld metropolis and symbol of corruption), Two Face (mayor), Slade (Roan De'arc (studies his body so he can become immortal)), Catwoman/Nightwoman (Saline De'arc), Bane (Underling of Slade who perfects serum to make him stronger. Knight uses his drugs to enhance his body after bane debilitates him), Angel

                        <p>Arc Reactor: after Angel’s death Night is able to harness their arc energy to create an endless supply of energy for metropolis but the downside is that it creates endless night time in the city.</p>

                      <h1>30 years after the Return of the Jedi</h1>
                        <p>Scenes- The Alliance Fleet approaches the grandiose shining New Alderaan. Admiral Solo confronts the counsel on trusting the Imperial Remnants. He says they signed a fake peace and is funding the Clone Crusaders to weaken the republic. Hobb Solo works on an old millenium falcon and Han chastises him and tells him to let go of the past.  with Padawan Suttina follow Lando and expose his daughter’s capture, locate the clone fleet rescuing Lando's daughter but are unable to rescue Lando’s wife. Realising that Luke cannot defend against the fleet again, Hobb, Flint and Suttina infiltrate the fleet and confront the fleet’s leader and Boba Fett.. The fleet attacks New Alderaan where Han uses the falcon fleet initiative to destroy it’s planet killing cannon.</p>
                        <p>Idea 11/02/2018 - after sacrificing his ship to shield new alderaan, Han boards the ship to rescue Flint, Hobb and Eva. Plagueis corrupts Eva and Flint but he is unable to possess Hobb because he is senseless to the force. Flint kills Han after saying that he forgives him. The ghost of Deja Solo defends Hobb after Dodeka is destroyed. She awakens the force in him and he is able to dodge Flint’s attacks while Taithera and him escape.</p>
                        <p>New Alderaan - After the defeat of the empire. Alderaan survivors as well as those displaced by the Empire's atrocities, came together to rebuild after the Rebellion's victory. Using Leia Organa as a focal point, the rebuilding of Alderaan represented all that was lost can be regained. Luke helps with the building of New Alderaan by moving a neutron star to be used as the core of the new world. New Alderaan leader became Queen Leia Organa who later would be essential to creating the Galactic Alliance. With light emanating from the center, large slabs of crust and small leaf like domes adorn its surface the artificial planet looks like a heaven.</p>
                        <p>Clone Crusader Fleet - This is a collection of old Imperial Vessels of the old regime and commanded by old clones of the empire and Phasma. Phasma started collecting clones phased out from the empire during the latter days of the empire. They destroy and plunder worlds looking for the strongest genetic templates to add to their cause. Basing their beliefs on the mandalorians of old, they believed in strength and battle to achieve more strength. Upon plundering the Kamino facilities they were able to create more clones. These children were raised in the mandalorian ways and more importantly this created a legacy they couldn’t create on their own. The clones themselves felt they were without purpose and tools of the galactic republic and empire. With the fleets teachings of strength, this gave them fervor to live and get vengeance against those who used them.</p>
                        <p>Coruscant - economic capital of the alliance. The planet has become polluted and corrupt to the point that the galactic alliance chooses to hold no political claim. Controlled by bureaucratic capitalist deciding to not support the clones triggered an attack by them. Half destroyed by an attack by the Clone Fleet, most of the Galactic Alliance officials fled to New Alderaan.</p>
                        <p>Master Luke Skywalker - Luke who is in his late 50’s has become a powerful Jedi but is estranged from the Jedi order because of his beliefs on the force and his connection to Darth Vader. Disappeared after this expulsion. He now no longer takes physical form though he is not dead. He can affect any area without being present. He keeps the clone fleet from completely destroying Coruscant. He divulges to his Padawan that he grows weak as he keeps a greater darkness at bay.</p>
                        <p>Queen Leia Organa - Head of the Alderaan Counsel, though unofficially called the Queen of Alderaan, Leia has dedicated her life to rebuilding Alderaan. Using her connections and compatriots of the rebellion New Alderaan was born from the rubble left from the first’s destruction. She has been separated from her former spouse for 20 years but now and then clashes with him in political dealings. Though Luke has divulged his connection to Darth Vader, Leia did not fearing she would lose influence and rebuilding Alderaan has been her primary focus. She was trained by Luke until her daughter died in an accident. After the loss of her daughter, she would fell to the dark side so Luke concealed the memories of her training. Years later she was able to confront her fear.</p>
                        <p>Han Solo - In the Galactic Alliance Military holds him high regard and with age he has become an able leader and a comrade in arms to those he fought with in the rebellion. His tactics are more conserved after his daughter was killed Chewbacca was injured on a maneuver against the Empire. The ships under his command are the Falcon Fleet with a mutilated Chewbacca at the helm of his falcon. His guilt from being unable to defend his friend and child has been the reason for his conserved tactics.</p>
                        <p>Grand Master of the Order Yon Duvaid - Old and decrepit with age he is the leader of the order on New Alderaan and once a fighter in the clone wars and the rebellion. The old man in his 80s struggles to keep peace and grow the fledgling Jedi Order. Always at awe to Luke’s power but cannot accept him after what his father did to the Jedi order. He hopes the force will guide him and wishes no ills against him.</p>
                        <p>Lando Calrissian - More of a businessman now that the Galactic empire is gone. Since the war ended he began a family and accrued great wealth. He is tied to the clones through covert dealings but only because his family is held hostage.</p>
                        <p>Grand Master  - Old padawan of Luke Skywalker and one of his few supporters. Advises the Galactic Alliance Counsel and is a connection to the Jedi Counsel. Finishes the training of Leia Organa in secret. Combine with Eva Suttina</p>
                        <p>Padawan Eva Suttina - She is a padawan of Master Skywalker and was considered lost and untrainable by most of the order but was taken in by Luke. Though he is not physically present to her, he is constantly with her through the force on Coruscant. From her time as a slave in the bowels of Coruscant she retains tattoos over her body, a clean shaven head and biting personality. She is in the last phases of her training to become a Knight but is held back by the order and her past. She wields a purple lightsaber she found as a child on Coruscant. Combine with Eva Suttina</p>
                        <p>Lieutenant Flint Organa - Ranger for the Galactic Alliance military and Jedi Knight. Hard man, stringent in his service for the military and Jedi. He blames his father's free spirit for his sister's death. Relationship with his brother is condescending yet loving though he is constantly awestruck by his capabilities in engineering and piloting. Falls to the dark side?</p>
                        <p>Hobb Solo - technical genius and flight specialist in the galactic alliance. Praised by Wedge Antilles for his designs on the “falcon fleet initiative”. Odd and eclectic, his free spirit is envied by his brother. He is unattached but humorously straightforward as a result of the loss of his sister. “Senseless” with the force he was unable to train as a jedi under the new order. The force comes to him through his genius. He’s able to go through hyperspace with the force later on and find Luke.</p>
                        <p>Deja Solo - late daughter of Han and Leia. Though she died as a young girl she grew within the force. She assist force senseless Hobb when he is at his lowest point.</p>
                        <p>Captain Wedge Antilles - Famous war hero during the rebel alliance and though old he still fights under Galactic Alliance. He is very close to Hobb and believes in the Falcon Fleet initiative started by Han Solo and finished by Hobb.</p>
                        <p>Dodeka - droid assistant to Hobb. It appears as a young girl whose appearance is similar to his late sister. While in the company of his father and mother, they express animosity towards it.</p>
                        <p>Deja Force Machination - at his lowest point Hobb is able to use the force once Dodeka is destroyed. He combines several metal components together that’s able to house the soul of his sister. This Force Machination is able to save him and Taithera from force corrupted Flint and Eva.</p>
                        <p>Taithera Calrissian - held captive by the imperial remnant in the cloud city depths. Her bratty persona conceals a soft center as a result of her mother's death. Allows her to grow closer to Hobb.</p>
                        <p>Dark Side Artifact- a dark side artifact that corrupts all within its reach.</p>
                        <p>ANK-008- clone of Anakin Skywalker - the young clone was taken by Boba Fett and trained to be a warrior of the clones. After Boba fetts demise she’s taken in by the Galactic Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Phasma - fiercely identifies with a woman she was cloned from and wishes to carry on her legacy. She works her way to the top of the Clone Crusader command structure. She was raised by Boba Fett but betrays him when she follows in the footsteps of the Jedi she was cloned from. The dark side artifact corrupts her making her bitter and ruthless</p>
                        <p>Chewbacca - after the demise of the millenium falcon he’s body is destroyed but he is kept alive. He is plugged into Han Solo’s new ship directly becoming its pilot. When the ship is destroyed it is revealed he has a large cybernetic body </p>
                        <p>Boba Fett - He was recruited by the Imperial Remnant to assist in the training of their new clone army. He trained the force sensitive clone, Phasma, directly spending the most time with her. After sensing the force she becomes corrupted by the Dark Side Artifact and is unrecognizable by Boba. After trying to escape with the ANK-008 he was captured and imprisoned. He was later released by Flint, Hobb and Eva. He battles Phasma and her force powers to save ANK-008.</p>

                      <h1>Mass Effect Andromeda</h1>
                      <p>Summary-</p>
                      <p>The initiative is launched from the Milky Way to settle Andromeda but also unbeknownst to them they are an escape attempt to the Reaper threat. The caravan is attacked by the reapers and the Nexus, hyperion, Leusinia and Natanus are separated. Extra dimensional beings save the arks awakening a Pathfinder from each vessel. The Pathfinder from the human ark, Hyperion, is one of the Ryder twins. Every Pathfinder is transported to an apex civilization to enrich them with technology from the milky way. There they encounter andromeda species that they cultivate and educate. It takes two millennia for the arks to reach their locations. Reaching their locations they find their Pathfinders are revered as gods by the andromeda populations. Cerberus hijacks the Hyperion Pathfinder through AI and seeks to dominate the galaxy using the extra dimensional beings into servants. Cerberus Pathfinder creates the Khett and amalgamation of species to meet their own ends. The Khett fight with the indigenous species and initiative to take over the EDBs technology and dominate the galaxy. The EDBs struggle against this and seek to have planets habitable for all species and then they redeem them.</p>

                      <h1>Holy Hearts</h1>
                      <p>Arcs: Ottican Revolt, Escape to the Grave, Erosan Winter, Royal Alliance, Oracle Falls, Conquer the Kings, The Plague Returns, Love Distorted, The Abysmal King, Ottica Calls</p>
                      <p>This is a story of how a god is made. Aorei's people run from a disease that ravages their world. The prince is able to open a portal taking him to the center and then Andera's world. Where they are labeled as saviors and then demons. Love, then hate.</p>
                      <p>Omnis - An Everlasting, unopposed entity unparalleled in strength and creation. Omnis made the world as a monument to it’s Strength. Upon seeing this world Omnis began to reflect. Acknowledging and surveying the world the creator became proud and a shadow grew over time. Within time, it found deeper caverns within his world and committed himself to know the deep. Upon reaching the end, his pride had left him becoming a sentient shadow and he wholly looked to the core of his world. An unceasing, unrelenting pain overtook him burrowing into his holiest of all hearts. The sentient shadow wishing to end the pain of it’s divine creator tore him from end to end, giving his master respite from his pain. At the end, across from the shadow’s fallen creator, was the core of Omnis.</p>
                      <p>Luta/Kosus - two inseparable entities enveloped in endless synchronicity.</p>
                      <p>Aorei/Andera - upon their first meeting they hated each other but they steadily grew together through the struggles they fought against together. She begins to be less trusting after those closest to her betray her. Lastly of those is Aorei and she shuts him out.</p>
                      <p>Kosus/Aorei - Prince of Ottica and son of the trader. Meant to be the node to control the plague and hoist their people to a golden age. Rescued by his mother and stepfather before the plague. The otticans believe him to be the true Emperor while ignoring the new kings. Aorei, through his connection with Andrea, is able to open a portal, first to Grave then Erosa. At first Aorei is distraught at sacrificing his own people but creates a philosophical understanding to it. In order to become the true king he must eat the hearts of the four kings.</p>
                      <p>Otticans - His people draw power from kols that form gates armoring the user with two forms. Only a select few, royalty, have this ability. Consume other kols in order to become stronger.</p>
                      <p>Plague - created by Aorei's father to reach true strength. It was unleashed upon his death and emerged from his partly eaten Kol. It turned Ottica from a lush jungle world into a desert. Black roots scourge the landscape with spores covering the skies. Once they take over a person they become part of the hive mind and they use that person's memories to find the weakness of anyone they attack by either turning their face into a loved one or tearing at their insecurities. Some can resist the transformations like the handmaiden and Aorei's brother but they are not to be trusted as their minds are warped.</p>
                      <p>The last push - the four kings come together believing the plague is weakening because it is retreating back to the epicenter. During the attack spores of a vast amount are dispersed into the sky catching the a great deal of the supporting units of guard turning Aorei's mother into the plague. Upon losing her Aorei summons the God armor and fights the epicenter directly but upon seeing his mother's gave in the tree he runs away opening the portal to Grave for all to follow.</p>
                      <p>Luta/Andera - a priestess whose world in an ice age is ruled by a dogmatic religious order. A young girl is sacrificed to the spirits but instead of dying she is given the power to influence them. Through meeting Aorei and confronting the evils of the world she loses friends and family while ultimately placing the blame on Aorei when he's not there for her.</p>
                      <p>Erosans - Spirits scourge their planet and leave lifeless anything it touches. After the arrival of the Otticans, knights are soon able to absorb these spirits and convert them into energy and matter. The oracle allows them to recall machines from the past to aid them.</p>
                      <p>Erosan Nuclear War - a great war that caused great destruction on Erosa and took many lives and ended Erosa’s golden age.</p>
                      <p>Erosan Catacysm - caused when the Oracle was created. Tired of all the suffering form the nuclear war the creator of the Oracle set a new beginning for Erosa.</p>
                      <p>God Kol Armor - controls the gates to other worlds and is an armor much larger than all the Kol armors. Once done with its shell is left behind and the user is exhausted.</p>
                      <p>Gates- inter-dimensional portals controlled by the emperor’s god armor. When fully controlled by Aorei's father the ottican empire was vast and powerful. Under the control of young Aorei they are random and nondirectional, often separating people going into the same portal. Accidentally summons his half plagued brother to the battlefield at one point. </p>
                      <p>Kol- core of the Ottican armors</p>
                      <p>Kol armors- first armor is human sized and covers the body of the user. Second armor varies in size and depends on the user. It transforms into flight mode and fight mode. Third armor is city sized and can only be attained by the emperor. Uses a weaponized beam from its Kol to fight in both modes.</p>
                      <p>Andera's grandfather - an old knight tired of battle and only finds pleasure in seeing his daughter happy.</p>
                      <p>Andera's sister - Adopted by Andera’s grandfather but is basically an older sister. She sacrifices herself several times to protect Andera.</p>
                      <p>Oracle's creator - a scientist who knew of the coming storm. 1000 years before storyline he finds a way to preserve the memories of the past. Using the oracle he causing a cataclysm that breaks the world.</p>
                      <p>Aorei's father - the last emperor of Ottica. The kings rebelled against him because of his experiments. Before he was "killed" by Aorei's step-father he spouted the famous words, "You dare look down on me?"</p>
                      <p>Aorei's Stepfather (King 1) - one of the last four kings of Ottica. Calls himself the Emperor even though he did not completely eat last emperor’s kol. He detest Aorei as he is the son of his enemy and is jealous of his sons control over the God armor. His faction lands on the furthest planet of Erosa solar system. Takes them several years to reach Erosa. A truly gigantic man. (Infected?)</p>
                      <p>Aorei's brother - Aorei's stephather's genetic son. Genius on the battlefield with a frightful second form. Believes he should be the true leader of their people. He soon realizes he doesn't have the potential like his brother. At Grave he kills Aorei’s handmaiden when he discovers she is infected. This enraged Aorei again as someone he cares about is killed again unleashing the God armor. He had the ability to create portals from Ottica to Erosa.</p>
                      <p>Aorei's friend - non royal friend is constant companion and playmate for Aorei.</p>
                      <p>King 2 - an old man who passed his kingship to his son before the last push believing he was soon to die of old age. His son died in the last push and had no royal sons to pass on the kingship so he temporarily takes it back. The wise old man expresses regret for rebelling against Aorei's father and after a one-on-one fight with Aorei he dies.</p>
                      <p>King 3 - experimented on by Aorei's father which ultimately caused the rebellion against him. Though his ailment has left him without sight his awareness and speed is unparalleled. His hate for Aorei is unparalleled. He sacrifices his whole clan for a chance to kill Aorei. Gives his subordinates to Cardinals for experimentation to enhance his abilities with their technology.</p>
                      <p>King 4 - narcissistic and beauty obsessed king whose joking and flirty personality conceals a bloodthirsty ruthlessness on and off the battlefield. His daughters are used by him strategically in his battles. Takes over the Knight order where he lands and commands the region with both Ottican and Erosan people loyal to him.</p>
                      <p>Aorei's mother - Died in the last push against the plague. It was said she always loved the Emperor. Often spoiled aorei and caused him at first to be a self centered personality.</p>
                      <p>Aorei's handmaiden - infected by the plague after her ship went down. She holds a baby within her clothing and won't reveal it to anyone saying it's unbelievably scarred from the accident. It's actually the plague partially inhabiting her. Once she is confronted by Aorei's brother it inhabits him, leading them to Erosa. </p>
                      <p>Aorei’s half sister - A daughter to the old emperor but from a separate mother than Aorei. She ends up on the other side of the continent with her father King 3. She fights with Aorei via her father's wishes as to honor him. She gains a relationship with an Erosan Knight but they are tragically separated when her body is given to the Cardinals to experiment on. Her armor becomes the first Erosan Knight Slayer but she is tragically killed and built into the armor. The Erosan Knight she fell in love with becomes it's pilot and enemy of Aorei.</p>
                      <p>Erosan Knight Slayer 1 - looks like a second Kol armor but instead of red and black it is white and blue. It is transformable and is soon mass produced into the Slayer 2.</p>
                      <p>Slayer 2 - mass produced fighter used by Knights and later used by non royal otticans. More fragile than Kol armors but can overwhelm an armor with tactics or numbers. Doesn't have a Kol to generate beams so it uses conventional and projectile weapons. Later employs more awakened technology into its weaponry.</p>
                      <p>Knight Orders of Erosa - army legions directly under the prophet. Regional orders often clash amongst each other. They are revealed old technology once the Otticans begin to clash with them and/or cohabitate with them. The five legions are represented by the five spirits. After the death of prophet, the Knight orders become semi-independent depending on the region.</p>
                      <p>Knight Crusaders of Erosa - legions dedicated to eliminating the Ottican invasion</p>
                      <p>The galaxies-  two are entwined and pulsating opposing energies</p>
                      <p>The Core - Between the two galaxies. Known as Grave, Hell or the Emptiness. It's a black landscape with a constant horizon that's unreachable no matter how far you travel. Only thing visible is the shell of the good armor in fight mode. Aorei's people are forced into a sleep state when they are there and only awaken when he dawns the God armor again taking them to Erosa.</p>
                      <p>Ottica - the one time jungle planet is now mostly desert with “the infestation” stretching like black roots across the world.</p>
                      <p>Erosa- a winter landscape with ruins of cites across the landscape. Spirits haunt the landscape and take souls. The planet is shattered in two and the capital lies at it’s center.</p>
                      <p>Erosa Spirits - Five large beast spirits roam the land and are sacrificed to in their respective regions: the lotus, pheonix, , wolf pack, chimera</p>
                      <p>Oracle- machine created by Andrea’s creator to house all the memories and generate the spiritual beast. Turns into the Holy city at the center of the earth after the cataclysm and used by the Cardinals for their base.</p>
                      <p>Erosa prophet- Head of Erosa’s religion and responsible for keeping technology hidden. He is killed by the Cardinals when they realised the technology was the only way to fend off the “demons”. After his death the Cardinals struggle to keep the knight orders under their command and use many different tactics such as hacking the oracles to control the spirit beast.</p>
                      <p>Erosa Cardinals - lesser prophets with scientific knowhow with the Oracle. Form a counsel instead of appointing another prophet. Each one vies for power but all believe the must keep order and stick to the tenants of their religion.</p>
                      <p>Erosa Crusader - Knight under Andera. Fell in love with her but never received her affection. Later he betrays her legions and... </p>

                      <h1>Before Incidence Arc (4 BI):</h1>
                      <p>Federation: Americas, Japan, Korea, Great Britain, West Europe, Australia, India, Parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                      <p>Confederation: East Europe, Russia, Middle East, North Africa, China, Oceania. Many of these nations have ties to Dilmun.</p>
                      <p>Lycanthropy: a private military company. Insignia is the planet showing the continents but silver mimicking the reflection of the moon. Commanded by Gai Volkahn with subcommander Amon Xirono.</p>
                      <p>Ashur Emirates: Once a very poor nation but was enriched because of the direction of Sargon Ashur. The people have fierce loyalty to </p>
                      <p>Neo Babylon: City in the Chaldean region of the confederation. Secret headquarters of Dilmun and where Amarosa Ananko is held</p>
                      <p>Dilmun: terrorist organization responsible for horrific acts all over the world. Their mission is to “enlighten the souls of humanity”. Confederation nations discreetly fund their activities.</p>
                      <p>Xisuthrus: “The wise one.” This supercomputer encases the mind of first Marduk, second Draco and then Thalatto. It’s the leader of Dilmun. With Marduk in control it tries to create peace with the Zeonic Expulsion as one of it's acts. Later when combined with Draco the supercomputer seeks to have the federation come into dominance by creating an incident plan to vilify the confederation and creating a war where they are disabled. After finding out Syn combined Draco with Xisuthrus, Thalatto forces her to combine himself with it. He alters the incident plan so that more people will suffer, just like him. Resides in Neo Babylon.</p>
                      <p>Treaty of Heaven: Signed by nuclear nations in 40 (BI). This treaty was signed as a front to prevent nuclear war by reducing the amount of nuclear weapons between the Federation and Confederation. Over time this declared the supremacy of the federation as its economic policies ushered forth greater technologies of war as the confederation's anti-capitalistic policies left it behind. </p>
                      <p>Giga: Means giant and refers to mechanical units called mobile suits. These suits are mainly used for mining and heavy lifting and employ a miniature nuclear engine to power it. Many companies employ such devices, it is only recently have they shown to have military applications (7 BI. Dilmun ).</p>
                      <p>Zionic Expulsion: Dilmun calls for desertion of the "Zionic Lands" as it has caused disputes between nations. Dilmun sets a date for the cities inside the lands “illumination”. Lycanthropy guards essential installations within the lands to protect them from nuclear detonation. They fail when Thalatto Marduk and Dilmun destroy these installations and abduct Doctor Ananko  (5 BI).</p>
                      <p>Operation Exodus: Mass emigration plan using the Incident as a catalyst to create cheap labor (8 AI).</p>
                      <p>Incident: Using Xisuthrus, Dilmun ignites every ICBM across the world starting the last world war. This incident is claimed by Dilmun "enlightening the world".

The division roots out corruption, gains intel and pacifies rebellions before they start. During the Adolescence Arc he likes to hang around Minerva giving her quiet support in her endeavors. He is very close to discovering Paladin as a spy but a series of lucky events keeps him from discovery. Albion’s personality is very flamboyant and he has an affinity for dressing up as a woman.

She becomes a professor for the Hannivale military academy though she doesn't want to go back onto the Aeternitas. When meeting Minerva their competitive nature makes them clash but they find commonality in their struggle.

                      <p>Gunhale Ananko: an empty shell of a man who regrets his cowardice and the loss of his friends. He's the janitor of Hannivale military academy but he's known for being able to fix anything</p>

                      <p>Admiral Xes Ananko: Admiral of the 2nd fleet and one of the main reasons colonists are now able to join the military on a wide scale.

                      <p>Athena: Considered an experiment on the Aeternitas. When paladin tries to hack into the federation database houses at the school, he inadvertently destroys it and from the aeternitas Athena takes over and almost captures him. Much to the chagrin of Xes the federation allows Athena to be the secretary of the school. Xes is shown to have a complete loathing for its existence and won't even acknowledge it's avatar. As secretary of the school the AI is there to assist all the students. Minerva at first wants to depend on her own abilities but soon understands she needs to accomplish her goals with its help.</p>
                      <p>Cybele: Created by Xes and is now the staple AI used by the federation space command. Assist all units but is much more inefficient than Athena</p>

                      <p>Side 3: becomes the center for the UFC under Lagash Lysander. There a nationalistic militarism is imbedded in the population. Lagash Lysander is treated like royalty and Orion Hannivale is treated like a holy martyr. Orion’s old mistress, Vera Thest and son, Otto Hannivale, are considered royalty as well</p>
                      <p>United Free Colonies: A movement started from numerous factions around the sides.
